> develop locally, build remotely.

## Must have
 - Project-local dotfile with configuration
 - Forward commands to remote machine over ssh
 - Push and pull wrappers (rsync?) to send code to/from remote machine
 - Ability to exclude directories from sync

## Nice to have
 - Setup (get an environment to a working state) - Small users don't need much setup, most can use config management

### For bigger users
 - Ability to swap out rsync for syncing (looking at you, monorepos)
